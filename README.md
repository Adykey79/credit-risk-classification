## Credit Risk Analysis Report: 
This analysis aims to provide a model that will identify customers with good creditworthiness. Creditors need to identify who has good and bad credit to make just decisions on any transactions they may want to do. The data set provided allows us to create a logistic regression model, categorizing loan risk as binary (0 = healthy, 1 = not healthy) and the rest of the columns as features (income, loan size, interest rate, etc.)

## Why use a logistic regression model? 
Logistic regression performs well when our target, or desired outcome, is binary. Additionally, we want to see how several variables, or features, affect that outcome. Considering the nature of our dataset and the situation, logistic regression is a strong choice.

# Classification Report

## Accuracy: 
0.99 | This model is highly accurate, meaning this model has high overall correct predictions.

# Summary

I would recommend this model to the company. This is due to the high levels of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1- scores provided by the classification report. One of the most important things that this model can provide is that it effectively mitigates the chance of a false negative, as seen in its recall score. This will drastically help the company identify true high-risk customers and make their decisions from there.
